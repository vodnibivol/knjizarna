# Knjižarna (Book-store)

An app I made for uploading PDF files of philosophy texts I had to read at university. Made it for fun, never used it once.

Had a lot of fun learning routing, server-side rendering, uploading, processing and serving documents, sending emails, storing user credentials on server and designing the old-school website look.
